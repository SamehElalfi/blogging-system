## About this repo

To learn more about the latest version of Laravel I decided to make a blogging system from scratch. I created many project using Laravel 6 and Laravel 7. But now there is Laravel 9 (and Laravel 10 is about to launch next month). To know what is the difference between these versions I started this repo as exercise.
